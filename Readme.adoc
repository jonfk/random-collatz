= Random Collatz checker

Fun little program that takes an argument and verifies whether the collatz
conjecture holds for that number. When no argument is given, it will test
a random number. This let's you test your luck. Will you be the one to find
a counter example to the Collatz conjecture?

== Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937.
The conjecture states that for any natural number over 0, applying the process below eventually reaches 1.

collatz 1 = [1]
collatz n
        | even n = n:collatz (n `div` 2)
        | odd n = n:collatz (3*n + 1)

== What does it mean?

Famous mathematician Paul Erd≈ës said about the Collatz conjecture: "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems."
